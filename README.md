# Introduction
This is an exercise to learn React, Redux, and Material UI.

I built this from scratch by:
1. Combining a couple of Read apps
  1. I liked the structure of one and the styling of the other; I wrote the third from scratch;
  1. I used Typescript with static typing instead of JavaScript
1. Migrated the React / Typescript Todo app to Redux
   1. Added the actions and their tests;
   1. Added the reducers and their tests;
   1. Got stuck! The static typing model to connect React Components to a Redux store is not intuitive!
   1. Understood the patters to connect React Components to a Redux store;
   1. Added the pattern to all components
